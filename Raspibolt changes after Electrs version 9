Some things need to be changed in the configuracion after latest update on Electrs from version 8 to 9.

//Add to "bitcoin.conf"
whitelist=download@127.0.0.1 //Allows Electrs to bypass the "maxuploadtarget=" for local P2P used for Electrs indexing.

//Add to "electrs.conf"
daemon_p2p_addr = "127.0.0.1:8333"

//Changes in "electrs.conf"    
"cookie =" has to be changed to "auth ="
"txid_limit =" has to be changed to "index_lookup_limit ="
"verbose = 4" has to be changed to "verbose = 2" for better performance

//Remove in "electrs.conf"
Remove unsupported options from configuration (blocks_dir, jsonrpc_import, bulk_index_threads, tx_cache_size_mb, blocktxids_cache_size_mb)

//Upgrade
If upgrading from v8, delete whole mainnet subdirectory within db_dir.
